#Post Malone's album, *'Austin'*, Random Song Generator

##Project Description

The intent of this project is to:
    1. Develop a simple js script
    2. Practice writing a helpful README file
    3. Practice pushing commits to Github.

While the js script is super basic, I have learned how to push changes to Github using the terminal. This did not come intuitively to me, as I'm used to saving files with a GUI.

##How to Use

Simply download the randsong.js file, and run it in the terminal with Node.js to see a randomly generated song from the 18 potential songs.
